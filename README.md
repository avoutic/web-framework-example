This is a base example implementation using [avoutic/web-framework](https://github.com/avoutic/web-framework).

In this example, a template for the database authentication config is provided in *includes/auth/db_config.main.php*. It is NOT recommended to keep the auth dir under version control and should be added to *.gitignore*.
